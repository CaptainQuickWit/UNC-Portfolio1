                <p>
                  Currently working as a customer support represenative for Spectrum's residential customers in the areas of repair, billing, and accounts. 
                  Customer Service is a great introduction to Spectrum's culture products and services, my current career goals are to work on the web based systems
                  that I use on a daily basis, such as our Customer Relationship Management system and technical support tools. To jump start my career as a developer I am 
                  attending UNC's full stack web development program and will graduate on July 21, 2021.
